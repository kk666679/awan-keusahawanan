## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services Architecture

The AI-powered website generation feature extends the existing Awan Keusahawanan platform with several new services:

1. AI Page API Service (Node.js 22+):
   - Handles incoming generation requests
   - Validates user input and business permissions
   - Interfaces with the job queue system
   - Provides status updates on generation jobs
2. AI Worker Service (Python/Node.js):
   - GPU-optimized container for AI inference
   - Integrates with HuggingFace transformers
   - Implements prompt engineering for Malaysian context
   - Handles output validation and sanitization
3. Queue Management System (BullMQ + Redis):
   - Manages job prioritization and scheduling
   - Implements retry logic for failed jobs
   - Provides real-time job status updates
   - Ensures fair resource allocation

### Malaysian Context Integration

The system includes specialized processing for Malaysian business needs:

1. Multi-language Support:
   - Understanding of prompts in Bahasa Malaysia, English, and Chinese
   - Generation of content in appropriate languages
   - Language detection and automatic translation capabilities
2. Cultural Adaptation:
   - Malaysian design patterns and color schemes
   - Local business terminology and categorization
   - Region-specific layout preferences
3. Business-specific Optimization:
   - Templates tailored for common Malaysian business types
   - Integration with local payment and logistics providers
   - SEO optimization for Malaysian search engines

### Frontend Components

1. Prompt Interface
   - Natural language input with suggestions
   - Style and language selection
   - Preview of generated design
2. Page Editor
   - Basic content editing capabilities
   - Real-time preview
   - Mobile responsiveness testing
3. Publication Dashboard

   - Dashboards in Grafana for operational visibility
4. Billing Integration:
   - Usage tracking through existing metering system
   - Integration with Stripe for payment processing
   - Resource-based billing (per generation or GPU-minute)

## Performance Considerations

1. GPU Resource Management:
   - Efficient model loading and inference optimization
   - Request batching for improved throughput
   - Automatic scaling based on queue length
2. Caching Strategy:
   - Prompt and result caching to avoid redundant processing
   - CDN integration for fast asset delivery
   - Session caching for improved user experience
3. Quality Assurance:
   - Automated testing of generated code validity
   - Performance benchmarking for page load times
   - Accessibility and SEO compliance checking

## Monitoring and Analytics
